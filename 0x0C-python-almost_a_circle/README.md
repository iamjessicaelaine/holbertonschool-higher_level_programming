# Project 0x09: Python - Almost a circle
A Holberton School project that will help prepare this budding technologist for the AirBnb project which is a big part of the school's higher level curriculum.

In this project, I will review everything about Python through my code, including:
- Import
- Exceptions
- Class
- Private attribute
- Getter/Setter
- Class methond
- Static method
- Inheritance
- Unittest
- Read/Write file
- *args and **kwards
- Serialization/Deserialization
- JSON

In addition to achieving the following learning objectives:
- What is Unit testing and how to implement it in a large project
- How to serialize and deserialize a Class
- How to write and read a JSON file
- What is *args and how to use it
- What is **kwargs and how to use it
- How to handle named arguments in a function
